##Build and run the project:

1. Import the code into an existing scala project structure. 

2. Use a command window to change into the example project directory

3 Build the project. Enter: `sbt run`. The project builds and starts the embedded HTTP server. Since this downloads libraries and dependencies, the amount of time required depends partly on your connection's speed.

4. After the message `Server started, ...` displays, enter the following URL in a browser: <http://localhost:9000>
